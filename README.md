Research regarding HashFlare and HashCoins

Checkout InititalResearch for base info.

Outside of collecting available info related to their current operation and capabilites, I am analyzing HashFlare's distribution wallets.  Reach me on twitter if you want to assist. https://twitter.com/@joshuagoode

#### Other goals:
 - Piece together company history
 - Review and report past and current controversies across HashCoins, HashFlare, and Polybius operations
 - Document current withdraw issues (December 2017) supposedly due to block.io and analyze their cause. Review HashFlare's response and elicit one from block.io.
 - Speculate required hash power to operate based on publicly shared contract data
